# "doorman" - the garage door monitor

This project monitors my garage door and notifies me when it opens or
closes, or when it has been open late at night.  It is made up of two
pieces: an Arduino that is located next to the garage door, and a python
script that runs on an internet-connected (Linux-based) computer.  They
communicate over a bluetooth serial connection.

This project contains:
 - the code for the Arduino
 - the python scripts and settings files
 - hardware schematics on how to hook up the sensors
 - some pictures
