"doorman" - the garage door monitor

This project monitors my garage door and notifies me when it opens or
closes, or when it has been open late at night.  It is made up of two
pieces: an Arduino that is located next to the garage door, and a python
script that runs on an internet-connected (Linux-based) computer.  They
communicate over a bluetooth serial connection.

More details can be found at http://blog.alanporter.com/2012-09-02/garage

This project contains:
 - the code for the Arduino
 - the python scripts and settings files
 - hardware schematics on how to hook up the sensors
 - some pictures

This has been a very fun project, and it is useful as well.  I hope you
enjoy it.  If you have questions or comments, please contact me.
